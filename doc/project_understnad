⭐ THE CORRECT ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE PROJECT
🟦 STEP 1 — Start with Terraform (Infrastructure Layer)
terraform/
Here you understand:
VPC
Subnets
EKS
RDS
ECR
IAM roles
Outputs (endpoints)

Why start here?
Because everything above (ArgoCD, K8s, Istio, Jenkins) depends on this infra.

🟦 STEP 2 — Helm Charts (Application Deployment Logic)
helm-charts/
Each service has its Helm chart:

    helm-charts/users/
    helm-charts/orders/
    helm-charts/payments/
    helm-charts/frontend/

    Here you understand:
    Kubernetes Deployment
        Service
        ConfigMap
        Secret
        HPA
        Env variables
        Docker image location
        DB connection details

Why next?
Because ArgoCD uses these Helm charts to deploy to EKS.


🟦 STEP 3 — Microservices (Application Code)

services/
    users/
    orders/
    payments/

Here you understand:

API endpoints
How each service interacts with DB
How they talk to each other
Emit metrics for Prometheus
Logging

Why now?
Because you need to see what the code expects from Kubernetes (ports, secrets, env).


🟦 STEP 4 — Istio (Traffic Management Layer)

istio/

Study these files:
gateway.yaml
virtualservice-users.yaml
virtualservice-orders.yaml
virtualservice-payments.yaml
destination-rules.yaml

Understand:
How external traffic enters cluster
How requests reach the correct microservice
How path-based routing works
How mTLS works
How retries/circuit-breaking works

Why now?
Because Istio routes all traffic, so it sits above services.

🟦 STEP 5 — ArgoCD (GitOps Layer)

argocd/
    app-of-apps.yaml
    apps/
        frontend.yaml
        users.yaml
        orders.yaml
        payments.yaml

Here you understand:
How Git changes deploy automatically
How Helm charts are pulled by Argo
Which namespace services deploy to

Why now?
Because this connects GitHub → Kubernetes.

🟦 STEP 6 — Jenkins (CI Layer)

jenkins/Jenkinsfile

Understand:
Docker build
Docker push to ECR
Updating Helm chart image tags
Triggering GitOps deployment

Why now?
Because Jenkins is CI, ArgoCD is CD — they work together.

🟦 STEP 7 — Monitoring (Observability Layer)

monitoring/
    prometheus-values.yaml
    servicemonitor.yaml
    grafana-dashboards/
    alertmanager/

Understand:
How metrics are scraped
How dashboards are loaded
How alerts fire
How ServiceMonitor discovers services

Why last?
Because observability is built after everything is deployed.

⭐ SO THE BEST STUDY ORDER:

1️⃣ terraform/
2️⃣ helm-charts/
3️⃣ services/
4️⃣ istio/
5️⃣ argocd/
6️⃣ jenkins/
7️⃣ monitoring/

This is EXACTLY how a real devops engineer thinks.
